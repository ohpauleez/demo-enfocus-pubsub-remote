# Demo: Enfocus, Shoreleave's PubSub and Remotes, and cljsbuild's Crossovers

This demo shows how to use common model code (in src/depr/crossovers/*) from both the server and the ClojureScript client.

It also shows how to use `shoreleave-remote` to interact with the server (provided by Noir, in this case), and how to use `shoreleave-pubsub` along with `enfocus` and html templates to declaratively populate the view and capture user input.

Feedback most welcome.
